    The ``net_arch`` parameter allows to specify the amount and size of the hidden layers,

    It is assumed to be a list of ints or a dict.

    1. If it is a list, actor and critic networks will have the same architecture.
        The architecture is represented by a list of integers (of arbitrary length (zero allowed))
        each specifying the number of units per layer.
       If the number of ints is zero, the network will be linear.

       ``dict(qf=[<critic network architecture>], pi=[<actor network architecture>])``.
       where the network architecture is a list as described in 1.

    For example, to have actor and critic that share the same network architecture,
    you only need to specify ``net_arch=[256, 256]`` (here, two hidden layers of 256 units each).
